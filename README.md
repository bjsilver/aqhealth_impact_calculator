# Air quality health impact calculator

These scripts are used to calculate the health impact of air pollution
using
* modelled air pollution concentrations
* gridded population data
* population age structure data
* baseline health data

Currently the scripts only use the GEMM health functions from Burnett et al. (2018)
but could later be expanded to use other health functions and other pollutants (e.g. O<sup>3</sup>)
